# Cplusplus-Program
# This project was to integrate C++ with Java. 
Given a class from Java, adding to, deleting from, and saving to a file was implemented as well.
A user menu was created to let a user decide what to do with a zoo animal file, to add animals, look up animals, and delete animals.  

#What did you do particularly well?
This code required looping through a class to fill a vector.

#Where can you enhance your code?
I believe the looks in general to the user can be improved as well as the creation of more classes and functions for the animals. 

#Did you find any code challenging?
Yes, I found that working with the vector in general challenging at first as well as when to open, save, and close the file in particular functions.  

#Resources
I'm always finding new things from the library to include and use for particular purposes.

#Useful
I was able to practice working with files which I think will help me in the future, as well as the basic concept of language integration.

#How was is made readable, maintainable, and adaptable?
Using a logical flow and with in-line comments made it readable, as well as the basic menu and instructions for the end-user.  It would be possible to build upon the current code to add any new classes of animal types.
